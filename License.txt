# Cloud Architectures and Security
## Vulnerable Web App

### SecureTrust Bank
Welcome to the "SecureTrust Bank" project, a unique exploration of cloud architectures and security. This project intentionally showcases fix for various vulnerabilities within a banking website hosted on an Azure virtual machine. Its primary purpose is to serve as an educational tool to highlight the critical importance of robust security practices in today's digital landscape.

SecureTrust Bank is a deliberately designed, secure web application that mimics a banking website. It fixes a range of security weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities commonly found in real-world cloud-based systems. By studying these fixes in a controlled environment, this project aims to promote awareness, understanding, and best practices in cloud security.

## Features

- Explore a invulnerable web application hosted on Azure VM
- Gain hands-on experience with identifying and mitigating common cloud security vulnerabilities
- Learn about potential risks, such as misconfigured services, weak authentication, and unencrypted data transmission
- Join the discussion within the cybersecurity community on strategies for securing cloud-based systems

This project is for educational and awareness purposes only and should not be used in a production environment. By using SecureTrust Bank, you'll have the opportunity to enhance your knowledge of cloud security and contribute to the ongoing effort to strengthen digital security practices.

Together, let's navigate the challenges of cloud architectures and security by examining the vulnerabilities within the "SecureTrust Bank" project. We believe that by understanding the risks, we can better protect the digital assets of organizations and individuals alike.
